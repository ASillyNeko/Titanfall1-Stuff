If You Are Using Attrition Extended Use `classic_execution 1` And Don't Add Titanfall1.Execution

I Don't Recommend Using `classic_rodeo 1`

Titanfall1.Nuke.Eject | Allows Nuke Ejecting Without The Titan Having To Be Doomed

Titanfall1.Model | Changes Titan Model To The One From Titanfall 1 Also Use Titanfall1.Execution | Required On Server And Client

Titanfall1.Execution | Uses Titanfall 1 Titan Execution

Titanfall1.Rodeo | Makes Rodeoing Titans About The Same As Titanfall 1
